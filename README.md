City view, where you can view your city and build/destroy special buildings. We used the [SKTiled](https://github.com/mfessenden/SKTiled) framework to handle the tilemap. Click the **build** button to place various buildings and the **destroy** button to bulldoze them. Certain buildings do certain things, and you can click on the buildings to learn more about them.

You can create military units in this building, which has a unique responsive UI. Military units can be sent to other planets via spaceships to conquer other planets and to eventually win the game.
